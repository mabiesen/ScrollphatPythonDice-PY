# ScrollphatPythonDice-py

Difficulties with the existing python script in Pimoroni's scroll phat libraries caused me to create this script for a project requiring dice.  One could use this python file as a reference to individual numbers or as a reference to some dice randomization.

Requires several imports, including Pimoroni's scroll phat libraries.
